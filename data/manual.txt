Welcome to Homestead, a game made by Mitchell Garrett!


How to navigate the main menu:

As you have already figured out, you can navigate the main menu using W/S/enter.


How to play:

Move your cursor around the map using W/A/S/D

When you start a new game you will be given a overhead view of your village.
At the top left you will see you village stats such as food, population, and resources.
At the top right you will see the current day (15 days in a season, 4 seasons in a year).

At the bottom left you will see another menu. Pressing the first letter of each option will select that option.
'Buildings' will open the buildings menu.
'Villagers' will open the villagers menu.
'End day' will skip to the next turn.

Once you enter a submenu you can exit using 'q' or repeating the first letter of that menu.

When you open the buildings menu you will see a list of buildings that can be built, with their associated wood (w) and stone (s) costs.
Navigate the buildings menu using W/D and build that building with enter. 
But be careful, the building will be placed where your cursor is on the map so make sure there is plenty of space.

When you open the villagers menu you will see you villager stats.
You will see your current population/max population, your current number of children/adults, 
how many unemployed adults there are, and how many of each specific worker you have.
If you have unemployed workers, you can navigate the workers menu using W/S and add/subtract workers with +/-.


Food and Villagers:

Each villager eats one food a day. If you do not have enough food to sustain your villagers, they will start dying off.
When you have enough food in your stores (3 * population), then a new villager will be born. 
Villagers are children for one whole year, then they become adults and are added to the work force.


Thank you for playing Homestead!
